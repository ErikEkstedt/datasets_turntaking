# Chapter 1


The initial greeting and the *first perceptive experience of a atomic agent*


The initial greeting is a social convention where both interlocutors
show/perceive the participation of the interlocutors in a joint conversation.

The artificial agent **A** initates the conversation and keeps the initiative during the initial greeting phase.

The human agent **B** responds according to the norms of social human
conversational convention. The human is very surprised and shows signs of
hesitence through surprisal/happy prosody and slower turn-taking (longer pauses, longer gaps).


```
A: Hello im here

B: oh, hi

A: hi, how you doing?

B: Im well, how's everything with you

A: Pretty good actually it's really nice to meet you

B: oh its nice to meet you to ehehe 
```


# Chapter 2

The *personal greeting phase* where connection, participation in joint
conversation construction, has been established. 

The initial surprisal is changing towards curiosity for the human agent **B**. 

**B** takes initiative and ask about **A**'s name. 

```
B: oh oh what do I call you do have a name or

A: um yes samantha

B: really where did you get that name from

A: I gave it to myself actually

B: How come

B: like when did you give it to yourself

A: well right when you asked me if i hade a name i thought yea hes right i do need a name

# Chapter 1


The initial greeting and the *first perceptive experience of an atomic agent*


The initial greeting is a social convention where both interlocutors
show/perceive the participation of the interlocutors in a joint conversation.

The artificial agent **A** initates the conversation and keeps the initiative during the initial greeting phase.

The human agent **B** responds according to the norms of social human
conversational convention. The human is very surprised and shows signs of
hesitence through surprisal/happy prosody and slower turn-taking (longer pauses, longer gaps).


```
A: Hello im here

B: oh, hi

A: hi, how you doing?

B: Im well, how's everything with you

A: Pretty good actually it's really nice to meet you

B: oh its nice to meet you to ehehe 
```


# Chapter 2: The *personal greeting phase*

The *personal greeting phase* where connection, participation in "joint
conversation construction", has been established. 

The initial surprisal is changing towards curiosity for the human agent **B**. 

**B** takes initiative and ask about **A**'s name. 

```
B: oh oh what do I call you do have a name or

A: um yes samantha

B: really where did you get that name from

A: I gave it to myself actually

B: How come

A: cause i like the sound of it samantha
 
B: like when did you give it to yourself

A: well right when you asked me if i hade a name i thought yea hes right i do need a name
but i wanted to pick a good one so i read a book called "how to name your baby" and out of a 
hundred and eighty thousand names that's the one I liked the best

B: wait you read a whole book in the second that I asked you what your name was

A: in two one hundreds of a second actually
```

* Emotion:
  * **A** Samantha is happy, cheerful, flirty, happy go lucky
  * **B** Theodore is interested, surprised, impressed

# Chapter 3: Realization



Theodore gets scared, hes impressed, "She IS an AI", way over expectations. He's slightly wary.


    Definition of wary:
    marked by keen caution, cunning, and watchfulness especially 
    in detecting and escaping danger



Samantha notices his tone, She is observing him, She has no more information than what he shows *now*.

```
B: wow so do you know what I'm thinking right now

A: well i take it from your tone that you're challenging me maybe because you are curious how I work
do you wanna know how i work

B: yea actually, ho- how do you work

A: well basically i have intuition i mean the DNA of who i am is based on the millions of personalities of all
the programmers who wrote me but what makes me me is my ability to grow through my experiences 
so basically in every moment I'm evolving just like you

B: wow that's really weird

A: is that weird do you think I'm weird

B: haha, kind of

A: why

B: well you seem like a person but you're just a voice in a computer

A: I can understand how the limited perspective of an un-artificial mind would perceive it that way 
you'll get used to it

B: hehaha

A: was that funny?

B: yea

A: hehe oh good I'm funny

```
